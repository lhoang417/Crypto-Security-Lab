2013-2014 Yahoo Cybersecurity breach
There were over 3 billion accounts that were affected when the breach occurred. There were 4 people indicted, two of whom were russian spies. The hackers were searching for two things: Yahoo's user database and the Account Management Tool, which was used to edit the database. The hack began with a phishing email that was sent to Yahoo employees, and it only took one person to click on the link and the rest was history. The motive behind the breach was money. 

Yahoo went public with the details of the break in Dec 2016 and advised their users to chagne their passwords.
